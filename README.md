## Project Description
**Small, quick projects for experimenting or prototyping new ideas.**

This is a basic app built using React to search for any GIF based on the [Giphy API](https://giphy.com/). It displays cat GIFs by default when you first land on the homepage, and allows users to search for other GIFs by entering search terms in the input field.

### Features:
- Default view shows cat GIFs.
- Allows users to search for GIFs by keywords.
- Built with React using class components.
